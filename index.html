        The first noel the angel did say
        <br>
        Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
        <br>
        In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
        <br>
        On a cold winter's night that was so deep

      </p>
      <p id="lyrics-style">
        They looked up and saw a star
        <br>
        Shining in the east beyond them far
        <br>
        And to the earth it gave great light
        <br>
        And so it continued both day and night

      <p id="lyrics-style">
        And by the light of that same star
        <br>
        Three wise men came from country far
        <br>
        To seek for a king was their intent
        <br>
        And to follow the star wherever it went
      </p>
      <p id="lyrics-style">
        This star drew nigh to the north-west
        <br>
        Over Bethlehem it took its rest

        <br>
        Right over the place where Jesus lay
      </p>
      <p id="lyrics-style">
        Then entered in those wise men three
        <br>
        Full reverently upon their knee
        <br>

        <br>
        Their gold and myrrh and frank incense
